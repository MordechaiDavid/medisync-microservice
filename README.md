# medisync - sample microservices-based healthcare system


medisync is a sample backend system for managing healthcare data, built in Java with Spring. It includes separate microservices with their own MySQL databases, and a module that translates natural language requests into API calls using an LLM.

## Services

- `Auth Service`: User registration, login, password reset
- `Patient Service`: Patient profile management
- `Doctor Service`: Doctor availability and profile
- `Appointment Service`: Scheduling and managing appointments
- `AI Assistant Service`: Natural language processing and REST API mapping
- **Each service has its own database**


---

## System Architecture Overview

The system is structured in the following layers:

1. **Client Applications**
    - Web Application
    - Mobile Application

2. **Service Discovery**
    - **Eureka Server**: Central registry for all microservices

3. **API Gateway**
    - Handles:
        - JWT Token validation
        - Routing
        - Rate Limiting
        - Load Balancing
        - Service Discovery integration



5. **External Storage**
    - AWS S3 (planned) for storing medical documents and images

6. **Database Layer**
    - Individual databases per service: `medisync_auth_db`, `medisync_doctor_db`, `medisync_patient_db`, `medisync_appointments_db`

### 6. AI Assistant Service
- **Purpose**: Simplifies user interaction through natural language processing
- **Features**:
  - Accepts natural language requests (e.g., "get all users")
  - Maps requests to appropriate REST API endpoints using an LLM
  - Sends HTTP requests to internal microservices
  - Formats and returns structured responses to users

   # Auth Service
   cd auth-service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # Doctor Service
   cd doctor-service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # Patient Service
   cd patient-service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # AI Assistant Service
   cd ai-assistant-service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
